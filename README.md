## Part 1 - Gutenberg HTML

The books came with their own <style> embedded in the HTML, so I commented that out and linked them to my style.css instead. I also added a <meta> viewport tag to make the page scale properly on mobile resolutions. On the whole, these pages do not need many changes. I left the `<pre>` tag style as-is to respect its purpose.

## Part 2 - Professional & Funny pages

I already did the whole assignment before I realized I was supposed to recreate the page from the comic. Instead, I thought the requirements wanted me to make a page about *myself*. Sorry!
